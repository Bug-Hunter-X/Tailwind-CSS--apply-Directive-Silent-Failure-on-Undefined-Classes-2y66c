The best way to avoid this issue is to ensure your Tailwind configuration is up-to-date and that you've correctly spelled all class names in your `@apply` directives.  Using a linter that checks for Tailwind class names can help.  You can also improve your workflow by using Tailwind's IntelliSense features (if your editor supports it).  This will help you avoid typos and ensure all classes are properly defined. 

Here's how you'd fix the example code by ensuring the classes exist:
```html
<div class="bg-blue-500 text-xl font-bold"></div>
```
